## Features

- Prevent accidentally turning up the volume on Windows
- Maintains volume limits even when the audio output device changes

### Background

This project was inspired by an issue with the Logitech K580 keyboard. When adjusting the volume using its keys, the keyboard frequently causes the volume to repeat uncontrollably, spiking to extreme levels. This was particularly problematic when wearing headphones, as my usual volume range is between 4 and 12 ‚Äî a sudden jump could be damaging.

Attempts to resolve this issue through Logitech's support were unsuccessful, leading me to create this solution.
